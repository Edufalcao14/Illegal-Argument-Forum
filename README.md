### A brief description of what this project is :
This is an academic project that I developed when I was learning my Web Development subject, the goal of this web site was to recreate a forum with the same goal of StackOverFlow, create a forum for programmers to interact with each other and solve problems. I implemented this website with Node.js and Express Framework for the back-end and applying MVC architecture , for the front-end we used HTML with Handlebars and pure CSS , we also modeled a database and implemented using MySQL.
This project allowed me to understand better the MVC architecture, also made me understand how worked an integration between back-end - Database and Back-End -- Front-End.
In the end I got a grade of 17.5 / 20 as a result of my project.
